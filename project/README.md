## Description

Turtle Road Crossing Game is a graphical game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. The player controls a turtle attempting to cross a road filled with moving cars. The goal is to safely navigate the turtle across the road to the other side without colliding with any cars.

The game consists of a main function and several other modules: `player.py`, `main.py`, `carmanager.py`, and `scoreboard.py`. These modules handle different aspects of the game, such as player movement, car management, and score tracking.

## Project Requirements

- The project must be implemented in Python.
- It should have a main function in a file called `main.py`, located in the root folder of the project.
- The main function should coordinate the game's execution by using the other modules.
- The `player.py` module should manage the player's turtle, allowing it to move up, down, left, and right.
- The `carmanager.py` module should handle the creation and movement of cars on the screen.
- The `scoreboard.py` module should track and display the player's score and game status.
- The game should end when the turtle collides with a car or successfully crosses the road.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aviiciii/turtle-road-crossing-game.git`
2. Run the game by executing `main.py` in the terminal: `python main.py`
3. Use the arrow keys to move the turtle and avoid the cars.
4. Reach the other side of the road to score points and advance to higher levels with more cars.
5. Have fun playing Turtle Road Crossing Game!
